# MovieFinder

Ever wanted to watch something on Netflix but had trouble deciding which movie to watch? MovieFinder allows you to search for, filter and compare movies based on ratings across multiple categories (such as IMDb, Rotten Tomatoes, or Google Users rating), allowing you to easily identify high-quality and well-rated movies to watch. Additionally, browse movies across multiple categories such as trending, popular or top rated.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
